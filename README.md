An agent-based model of social interaction with quantal response
================================================================

This project tries to compare agent-based and maximum entropy modelling in the
context of a simple social interaction problem. In particular, we develop an
agent-based model of a general social interaction problem with features inspired
by quantal response statistical equilibrium techniques.
